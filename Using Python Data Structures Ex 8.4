# 8.4 Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words 
#using the split() method. The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check to see 
#if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list. When the program completes, sort and print the 
#resulting words in alphabetical order.
#You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/romeo.txt
